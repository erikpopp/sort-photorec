# sort-photorec
A BASH script that sorts the files that photorec recovers into folders by their file extension

photorec is an amazing tool, but it's hard to process the files that it recovers. They usually don't have the original names, and they're all dumped into a single folder.
sort-photorec makes photorec more useful by putting all the files with a given extension into their own folder.
It handles files without extensions by putting them in a separate folder named "No File Extension".
